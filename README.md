Build Instructions
------------------
To build and run:
'make run'

Comparison to MPI
-----------------
In my original code, using the real MPI, calls I observerved far lower latency compared to my implementation. My implementation produced far slower message passing, with some cases proving to be 100s to 1000s of times slower.
